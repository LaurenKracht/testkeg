This application is a simple demonstration.

It's written as a React app with ****** modules and endpoints.


Using This Example
------------------


Clone this repository, and then build the application:

```
npm install
npm run compile
```

To deploy, first install the ****** command line tool.
 

```
sudo pip install ************************************************
